Hi, i was created using cat command
> symbol before file name creates file.

cat creates, views, copies, concatenate, etc files
 create as:   cat > filename.txt   n press control D after writing inside file
 
 cat *.txt
 cat fileName  >  fileName rerplaces content
   cat name1 >> name2   appends
   
   thr 4 sections in git are:   untracked section of files; the modified and unodified one and stages section....  the changes to be commied will be only for stages section. make sure all modified files are staged so changes ca ba made..
   
   note:snapshot is taken only when git commit command is run
   
   
command_echo appends text inside a file

we can add directory to .gitignore
also empty folders are not tracked by git.

example  echo dir/ >> .gitignore

now; if static/dir/ xyz.txt is path....  whole static folder will be ignored as dir is ignoreed and then static is empty

but if static has 2 files,  dir and abc.txt  then it wont be  ignored....
